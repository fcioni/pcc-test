# pcc-test
A test repository for me to try adding documentation
### Test
Here is a repository where I am going to work out how viable GitHub is as a place to put PCC documentation for task groups to work on.  


One of the pieces of documentation I have added here is:  
[PCC Policy on Compilations of Works by One Agent](https://github.com/fcioni/pcc-test/blob/main/pcc-policy-on-compilations-of-works-by-one-agent.md)
