# pcc-test
A test repository for me to try adding documentation
### Test
Here is a repository where I am going to work out how viable GitHub is as a place to put PCC documentation for task groups to work on.  


One of the pieces of documentation I have added here is:  
[PCC Policy on Compilations of Works by One Agent](https://github.com/fcioni/pcc-test/blob/main/pcc-policy-on-compilations-of-works-by-one-agent.md)  
Another document is this one:  
[NACO 024 Best Practices Guidelines](https://github.com/fcioni/pcc-test/blob/main/naco-024-best-practices-guidelines.md)  

I have worked out how to:  
- Create documentation in GitHub including formatted text, lists, tables using Markdown
- Edit documentation using pull requests  
- Link to documentation in the ReadMe file  
- Embed documentation hosted on Github in Confluence Wiki pages using the GitHub Markdown macro - it updates automatically from the GitHub.

Things I still want to work out:  
- [ ] Is the GitHub Markdown macro in Confluence included or is it the add-on that I added which would be expensive for multiple users?
- [ ] The GitHub Markdown macro doesn't quite render things perfectly -- the Note thing, the table, quote formatting didn't look quite the same. Maybe we'd need to use very basic formatting only
- [ ] What is the best way to organise documentation in GitHub?
