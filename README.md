# pcc-test
A test repository for me to try adding documentation
### Test
Here is a repository where I am going to work out how viable GitHub is as a place to put PCC documentation for task groups to work on.  


One of the pieces of documentation I have added here is:  
[PCC Policy on Compilations of Works by One Agent](https://github.com/fcioni/pcc-test/blob/main/pcc-policy-on-compilations-of-works-by-one-agent.md)  
Another document is this one:  
[NACO 024 Best Practices Guidelines](https://github.com/fcioni/pcc-test/blob/main/naco-024-best-practices-guidelines.md)  

I have worked out how to:  
- Create documentation in GitHub including formatted text, lists, tables using Markdown
- Edit documentation using pull requests  
- Link to documentation in the ReadMe file  
- Embed documentation hosted on Github in Confluence Wiki pages using the GitHub Markdown macro - it updates automatically from the GitHub.

Things I still want to work out:  
- [x] Is the GitHub Markdown macro in Confluence included or is it the add-on that I added which would be expensive for multiple users?
- [ ] The GitHub Markdown macro doesn't quite render things perfectly -- the Note thing, the table, quote formatting didn't look quite the same. Maybe we'd need to use very basic formatting only
- [ ] What is the best way to organise documentation in GitHub?

[GitHub Macros for Confluence](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1216734/github-macros-for-confluence?tab=overview&hosting=cloud) is free for up to ten users, costs $0.85 per user per month for 11-100 users, $0.48 per user per month for 101-250 users, $0.28 per user per month for 251-1000 users, etc.  
If we chose not to use **GitHub Macros for Confluence** it would be possible just to add links to individual files on the Wiki pages. As well as being free, an advantage of this is that links are more compact than embedded documentation, so scrolling is more easily navigable.
