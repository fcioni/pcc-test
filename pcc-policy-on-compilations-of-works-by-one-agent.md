# PCC Policy on Compilations of Works by One Agent  
> [!NOTE]
> The [NACO Advisory Group](https://www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/naco/NACOAdvisoryGroup.html) will be the primary contact for questions. The NACO Advisory Group can be contacted at [naco@loc.gov](naco@loc.gov). Please include “**New PCC Policy Partial Compilations**” in the Subject line to assist in directing the message to the NACO Advisory Group.  

### General  
Under the new policy, the Alternative in RDA 6.2.2.10.3 will not be applied to partial compilations of single forms by one agent or partial compilations of multiple forms by one agent. See [Interim Policy Update #2](https://www.loc.gov/aba/rda/pdf/interim-policy-update-2-2021.pdf): LC-PCC-PS 6.2.2.10.3 Alternative (elimination of the use of Conventional Collective Titles 
(CCTs) for post-1500 works) (April 22, 2021) [PDF, 112 KB] (Posted on the RDA Interim Policy Updates page on the [Library of Congress Acquisition and Bibliographic Access website](https://www.loc.gov/aba/rda/))  

### Scope  
Compilations of works that were created after 1500, other than compilations of musical works, or laws, etc., are in scope for the new policy, as long as the resource being described is a partial compilation by one agent. Partial compilations in more than one form by one agent are also in scope. The new policy 
relies less on the use of conventional collective titles (CCTs) in the cataloging of resources for which CCTs would have been used in the past. In the past, resources in scope would have been described with a CCT: 
 
>       240 10 $a [Form]. $k Selections  
>       For partial compilations of one form  
*or*   
>       240 10 $a Works. $k Selections  
>       For partial compilations of more that one form  

**The following categories of resources are not in scope for the new policy:**
- Partial compilations of works by one agent that were created **and compiled** <ins>before 1501</ins> are not in scope.
- <ins>Complete</ins> compilations of an agent's works, or of an agent's works in one form, are not in scope.
- Partial compilations of works created by <ins>more than one agent</ins> are not in scope.
- Authorized access points for multipart monographs and monographic series are not in scope.
- Compilations of parts of a single work or excerpts from a single work are not in scope.
- Compilations of musical works are not in scope. Continue to apply RDA 6.2.14.8.
- Laws, etc., are not in scope. Continue to apple RDA 6.19.2.5.1 and RDA 6.19.2.6.

## Applying the new policy

### General
When cataloging a resource that consists of a partial compilation of works by one agent, rather than applying the Alternative in RDA 6.2.2.10.3 to use a conventional collective title for the form followed by Selections as the preferred title of the resource, apply RDA 6.2.2.4 instead:  
> *For works created after 1500, choose as a apreferred title for work the title or form of title in the original language by which the work is commonly identified either through use in manifestations embodying the work or in reference sources.*   

The title under which the resource is puiblished is considered the "commonly identified" title. The concept of "adequate" or "distinctive" title, as applied under AACR2 and LCRI cataloging, is not a consideration of the new policy. All manifestation titles are considered "adequate" or "distinctive". If the same compilation as been published more than once under different titles, choose the most common form of title (or the first-published title) as the preferred title and recrod the other titles as variants.  

Partial compilations of works by one agent that were created <ins>before 1501</ins> but were not compiled before 1501 are in scope for the new policy. A collection of poems, for example, could be a modern compilation of works created before 1501, but not be a collective work until after 1500. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, assume it's a new compilation.  

### Translations  
Translations are within scope for the new policy. There are two categories of translations, depending on whether or not the partial compilation was published as a compilation in th eoriginal language. See the examples are the end of this policy statement for more information on translations.  

### Series Authorized Access Points  
Authorized access points for multipart monographs and monographic series should continue to use conventional collective titles.  

### Authority Work and Determining Conflict  
If a resources withing scope for the new policy has a manifestation title that is represented as a variant access point in an existing convenitonal collective title authority record, there are two options for resolving the conflict:  
1. If the variant access point in the existing conventional collective title authority record represents the same resource being described (verify this by looking at the 670 field that justifies the variant accesspoint), remove the variant access point and the 670 field from the authority record and describe the resource by applying RDA 6.2.2.4. Since the conventional collective title authority record is most likely an  “undifferentiated” work authority record, the record should not be recoded to RDA, if it is not already coded RDA. This is an exception to the PCC policy that all non-RDA authority records must be recoded to RDA when a change is made to the record;  
2. If the variant access point in the existing conventional collective title authority record does not represent the same resource being described (for example, it may represent an earlier or later edition of the work, or a different compilation of works altogether), there is a NACO 1XX/4XX conflict that needs to be resolved. A qualifier can be added to the 4XX in conflict. It is not necessary to re-code the authority record to RDA, if it is not already coded RDA. This is an exception to the PCC policy that all non-RDA authority records must be recoded to RDA when a change is made to the record.  

Under the new policy, conflict will be determined according to the General statement in LC-PCC PS for 6.27.1.9, Additions to Access Points Representing Works: 
> *Define the "catalog" as the file against which the searching and cataloging is being done. In addition, catalogers (including LC overseas offices' catalogers) may take into account any resource with the same authorized access point of which they know, whether or not it is in the catalog.*  

Authority records optionally may be created in the case of conflict as determined by LC-PCC PS for 6.27.1.9. However, do not create an authority record only to provide variant access from a conventional collective title construction. One of the goals of the new policy is to reduce the number of new authority records representing works.  

The PCC Standing Committee on Standards (SCS) has created a separate [FAQ on Authorized Access Points for Collections of the Works of Individual Agents and Works of Unknown Responsibility that Pruport to be by an Individual Agent](https://www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/naco/documents/FAQ-AAP-Collections.pdf) (Oct. 2020, rev. May 2021) for working with "undifferentiated" conventional collective title work and expression authority records. See page 17 (***NACO Authority File Maintenance***) of that document.
