# PCC Policy on Compilations of Works by One Agent  
> [!NOTE]
> The [NACO Advisory Group](https://www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/naco/NACOAdvisoryGroup.html) will be the primary contact for questions. The NACO Advisory Group can be contacted at [naco@loc.gov](naco@loc.gov). Please include “**New PCC Policy Partial Compilations**” in the Subject line to assist in directing the message to the NACO Advisory Group.  

### General  
Under the new policy, the Alternative in RDA 6.2.2.10.3 will not be applied to partial compilations of single forms by one agent or partial compilations of multiple forms by one agent. See [Interim Policy Update #2](https://www.loc.gov/aba/rda/pdf/interim-policy-update-2-2021.pdf): LC-PCC-PS 6.2.2.10.3 Alternative (elimination of the use of Conventional Collective Titles 
(CCTs) for post-1500 works) (April 22, 2021) [PDF, 112 KB] (Posted on the RDA Interim Policy Updates page on the [Library of Congress Acquisition and Bibliographic Access website](https://www.loc.gov/aba/rda/))  

### Scope  
Compilations of works that were created after 1500, other than compilations of musical works, or laws, etc., are in scope for the new policy, as long as the resource being described is a partial compilation by one agent. Partial compilations in more than one form by one agent are also in scope. The new policy 
relies less on the use of conventional collective titles (CCTs) in the cataloging of resources for which CCTs would have been used in the past. In the past, resources in scope would have been described with a CCT: 
 
>       240 10 $a [Form]. $k Selections  
>       For partial compilations of one form  
*or*   
>       240 10 $a Works. $k Selections  
>       For partial compilations of more that one form  

**The following categories of resources are not in scope for the new policy:**
- Partial compilations of works by one agent that were created **and compiled** <ins>before 1501</ins> are not in scope.
- <ins>Complete</ins> compilations of an agent's works, or of an agent's works in one form, are not in scope.
- Partial compilations of works created by <ins>more than one agent</ins> are not in scope.
- Authorized access points for multipart monographs and monographic series are not in scope.
- Compilations of parts of a single work or excerpts from a single work are not in scope.
- Compilations of musical works are not in scope. Continue to apply RDA 6.2.14.8.
- Laws, etc., are not in scope. Continue to apple RDA 6.19.2.5.1 and RDA 6.19.2.6.

## Applying the new policy

### General
When cataloging a resource that consists of a partial compilation of works by one agent, rather than applying the Alternative in RDA 6.2.2.10.3 to use a conventional collective title for the form followed by Selections as the preferred title of the resource, apply RDA 6.2.2.4 instead:  
> *For works created after 1500, choose as a apreferred title for work the title or form of title in the original language by which the work is commonly identified either through use in manifestations embodying the work or in reference sources.*   

The title under which the resource is puiblished is considered the "commonly identified" title. The concept of "adequate" or "distinctive" title, as applied under AACR2 and LCRI cataloging, is not a consideration of the new policy. All manifestation titles are considered "adequate" or "distinctive". If the same compilation as been published more than once under different titles, choose the most common form of title (or the first-published title) as the preferred title and recrod the other titles as variants.  

Partial compilations of works by one agent that were created <ins>before 1501</ins> but were not compiled before 1501 are in scope for the new policy. A collection of poems, for example, could be a modern compilation of works created before 1501, but not be a collective work until after 1500. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, assume it's a new compilation.  

### Translations  
Translations are within scope for the new policy. There are two categories of translations, depending on whether or not the partial compilation was published as a compilation in th eoriginal language. See the examples are the end of this policy statement for more information on translations.  

### Series Authorized Access Points  
Authorized access points for multipart monographs and monographic series should continue to use conventional collective titles.  

### Authority Work and Determining Conflict  
If a resources withing scope for the new policy has a manifestation title that is represented as a variant access point in an existing convenitonal collective title authority record, there are two options for resolving the conflict:  
1. If the variant access point in the existing conventional collective title authority record represents the same resource being described (verify this by looking at the 670 field that justifies the variant accesspoint), remove the variant access point and the 670 field from the authority record and describe the resource by applying RDA 6.2.2.4. Since the conventional collective title authority record is most likely an  “undifferentiated” work authority record, the record should not be recoded to RDA, if it is not already coded RDA. This is an exception to the PCC policy that all non-RDA authority records must be recoded to RDA when a change is made to the record;  
2. If the variant access point in the existing conventional collective title authority record does not represent the same resource being described (for example, it may represent an earlier or later edition of the work, or a different compilation of works altogether), there is a NACO 1XX/4XX conflict that needs to be resolved. A qualifier can be added to the 4XX in conflict. It is not necessary to re-code the authority record to RDA, if it is not already coded RDA. This is an exception to the PCC policy that all non-RDA authority records must be recoded to RDA when a change is made to the record.  

Under the new policy, conflict will be determined according to the General statement in LC-PCC PS for 6.27.1.9, Additions to Access Points Representing Works: 
> *Define the "catalog" as the file against which the searching and cataloging is being done. In addition, catalogers (including LC overseas offices' catalogers) may take into account any resource with the same authorized access point of which they know, whether or not it is in the catalog.*  

Authority records optionally may be created in the case of conflict as determined by LC-PCC PS for 6.27.1.9. However, do not create an authority record only to provide variant access from a conventional collective title construction. One of the goals of the new policy is to reduce the number of new authority records representing works.  

The PCC Standing Committee on Standards (SCS) has created a separate [FAQ on Authorized Access Points for Collections of the Works of Individual Agents and Works of Unknown Responsibility that Pruport to be by an Individual Agent](https://www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/naco/documents/FAQ-AAP-Collections.pdf) (Oct. 2020, rev. May 2021) for working with "undifferentiated" conventional collective title work and expression authority records. See page 17 (***NACO Authority File Maintenance***) of that document.  

### Classification and Collocation  

Resources in scope for the new policy that are classed in Class P (Language and Literature) will be classed as separate works. This also includes translations, which will be classed following the Translation Table (Classification and Shelflisting Manual (CSM), instruction sheet G150, Translations/ Texts in Parallel Languages), rather than applying a form Cutter (see the translation example below). Optionally, collocation can be achieve through the use of an LGCFT term in the 655 field, or an LCGFT term in the 380 field:  
> 655 #7 $a Poetry. $2lcgft
*or*
> 380 ## $a Poetry $2 lcgft


## 1. General Examples

### Example 1-1  

> 050 00 $a PS3552.R4174 $b W67 2020

> 655 #7 $a Poetry. $2 lcgft
> 700 12 $i Container of (work): $a Brewer, Gaylord, $d 1965- $t Dark hello.

*A compilation of selected poems by Gaylord Brewer. RDA 6.2.2.4 is applied and the manifestation title is used instead of a conventional collective title Poems. Selections. The resource is classed as a separate work, and the LCGFT term Poetry is assigned for collocation purposes. An analytical authorized access point is given for the first work in the compilation according to LC-PCC PS for 25.1 (For compilations of works, give an analytical authorized access point for the predominant or first work in the compilation when it represents a substantial part of the resource. Optionally, give analytical authorized access points for works other than the predominant or first work, if considered important for access).*

### Example 1-2  

> 050 00 $a PS3606.R445465 $b P37 2020

> 700 12 $i Container of (work): $a Freeman, John, $d 1974- $t Easement.

*A compilation of selected poems by John Freeman. RDA 6.2.2.4 is applied and the manifestation title is used instead of a conventional collective title Poems. Selections. The resource is classed as a separate work, and the LCGFT term Poetry is assigned for collocation purposes. Analytical authorized access points are given for the first poem in each of the sets in the compilation according to LC-PCC PS for 25.1 (For compilations of works, give an analytical authorized access point for the predominant or first work in the compilation when it represents a substantial part of the resource. Optionally, give analytical authorized access points for works other than the predominant or first work, if considered important for access).* 

### Example 1-3

> 050 00 $a PS3608.E776 $b F36 2019  
> 100 1# $a Herrmann, Duane L., $e author.  
> 245 10 $a Family plowing and other prairie poems : $b new and used / $c Duane L. Herrmann.  
> 655 #7 $a Poetry. $2 lcgft  
> 700 12 $i Container of (work): $a Herrmann, Duane L. $t Family plowing.  

*A compilation of selected poems by Duane L. Herrmann. RDA 6.2.2.4 is applied and the manifestation title is used instead of a conventional collective title Poems. Selections. The individual poem Family plowing is included in the compilation. An analytical authorized access point is given for the poem according to LC PCC PS for 25.1 (For compilations of works, give an analytical authorized access point for the predominant or first work in the compilation when it represents a substantial part of the resource. Optionally, give analytical authorized access points for works other than the predominant or first work, if considered important for access).*  

### Example 1-4  

> 050 00 $a PS3501.K5 $b H56 1937  
> 100 1# $a Akins, Zoë, $d 1886-1958, $e author.  
> 240 10 $a Hills grow smaller (Poem)  
> 245 14 $a The hills grow smaller / $c by Zoë Akins.  
> 655 #7 $a Poetry. $2 lcgft  

*This is not a compilation. It is a single poem by Zoë Akins. A compilation titled The hills grow smaller does exist and conflicts with the title of the individual poem. A qualifier is added to the title in the 240 field to break the conflict. The resource is classed as a separate work, and the LCGFT term Poetry is assigned for collocation purposes.*  

### Example 1-5  

> 050 00 $a PS3604.O53 $b S73 2009  
> 100 1# $a Donaghy, Daniel, $d 1970- $e author.  
> 240 10 $a Start with the trouble (Compila�on)  
> 245 10 $a Start with the trouble : $b poems / $c by Daniel Donaghy.  
> 655 #7 $a Poetry. $2 lcgft

*A compilation of selected poems by Daniel Donaghy. RDA 6.2.2.4 is applied and the manifestation title is used instead of a conventional collective title Poems. Selections. The individual poem Start with the trouble is included in the compilation, and the cataloger has identified this as a conflict according to LCPCC PS 6.27.1.9. A uniform title is assigned in the 240 field to break the conflict. The resource is classed as a separate work, and the LCGFT term Poetry is assigned for collocation purposes. The cataloger did not add analytical authorized access points in this case.*

*The authority record is already coded RDA. The cataloger should remove the variant access point and the supporting 670 note and report BFM if necessary.*  

*The LCGFT term Short stories is assigned for collocation purposes.*

*Three analytical authorized access points are given for the three stories in the compilation according to LC-PCC PS for 25.1 (For compilations of works, give an analytical authorized access point for the predominant or first work in the compilation when it represents a substantial part of the resource. Optionally, give analytical authorized access points for works other than the predominant or first work, if

> 700 12 $i Container of (work): $a Aldrich, Bess Streeter, $d 1881-1954. $t Star across the tracks.  

*A compilation of two short stories by Bess Streeter Aldrich. RDA 6.2.2.4 is applied and the manifestation title is used instead of a conventional collective title Short stories. Selections. The individual short story Journey into Christmas is included in the compilation, and the cataloger has identified this as a conflict according to LC-PCC PS 6.27.1.9. A uniform title is assigned in the 240 field to break the conflict. The resource is classed as a separate work, and the LCGFT terms Christmas fiction and Short stories are assigned for collocation purposes. The cataloger added two analytical authorized access points for the two short stories in the compilation.*

### Example 1-8

*A  multi-part compilation of more than one form by Lady Gregory. RDA 6.2.2.4 is applied and the manifestation title is used instead of a conventional collective title Works. Selections. The forms included in the compilation are identified in the LCGFT terms assigned in the 655 fields. The resource is classed as a separate work.*

### Example 1-9  

> 050 00 $a PQ4266.A3 $b G56 1995  
> 100 1# $a Boccaccio, Giovanni, $d 1313-1375, $e author.

> 655 #7 $a Short stories. $2 lcgft  

*A new partial compilation of works by Boccaccio that was published in 1995. The individual works in the compilation were created before 1501, but the compilation did not appear for the first time until 1995. The compilation is classed as a separate work and because there is a conflict with another resource with the same creator and title proper, the preferred title is qualified with the surname of the compiler to break the conflict (RDA 6.6, Other Distinguishing Characteristic of Work)*  

## 2. Translations

Translations can fall into one of two categories under the new policy. If a translation of a partial compilation has been published as a compilation in the original language, the preferred title of the original language compilation will be used, followed by the language of translation. It is not necessary to do exhaustive research to determine the title in the original language. Apply this only if the title in the original language is readily available, keeping in mind that often it is very difficult to determine whether the same compilation even appeared in the original language.

### Example 2-1  

> 050 00 $a PS3505.A87 $b L3817 1997  
> 100 1# $a Cather, Willa, $d 1873-1947, $e author.  
> 240 10 $a Later novels. $l Russian  
> 245 14 $a Pozdnie romany / $c Uilla Kėtėr.  
> 655 #7 $a Novels. $2 lcgft  

*A Russian translation of novels by Willa Cather, published originally in English under the title Later novels. The translation is treated as a separate work and the Translation Table is used (.x17 = Russian 
Translation), not the Form Cutter .A5-.A59 (TABLE P-PZ40).*  

If a translation of a partial compilation has <ins>not</ins> been published as a compilation in the original language, the resource being described will use the title proper of the translation as the preferred title. In case of doubt, use the title proper of the translation as the preferred title.

### Example 2-2

> 050 04 $a PL845.B4 $b T46 1993  
> 100 1# $a Abe, Kōbō, $d 1924-1993, $e author.  
> 245 10 $a Three plays / $c by Kōbō Abe ; translated, and with an introduction by Donald Keene.  
> 655 #7 $a Drama. $2 lcgft  

*This compilation of three translated plays was never published as a compilation in the original language. The preferred title for this resource will be the English title, since there is no Japanese title for the compilation.*  

In case of doubt, use the title proper of the translation as the preferred title.  

### Example 2-3  

> 050 04 $a PL2919.Y448 $b S8613 2022  
> 100 1# $a Wang, Yin, $d 1962- $e author.  
> 245 12 $a A summer day in the company of ghosts / $c by Wang Yin ; translated by Andrea Lingenfelter.  
> 655 #7 $a Poetry. $2 lcgft  
> 700 12 $i Container of (work): $a Wang, Yin, $d 1962- $t Summer day in the company of ghosts.  
> 700 12 $i Container of (expression): $a Wang, Yin, $d 1962- $t Summer day in the company of ghosts. $l Chinese.    

*This compilation contains the original expression of poems in Chinese, and the same poems translated into English. The compilation was never published as a compilation in the original language. LC-PCC PS 6.27.3 applies, so analytical access points are required for both the Chinese poems and the English translations.*  

*However, since there is no Chinese title for the compilation, the English title is selected, according to RDA 6.2.2.4. Since this compilation contains the original language and a single translation, the resource is classed as a translation and .x13 is added to the call number.*  

## 3. Art  

### Example 3-1  

>050 00 $a ND553.P5 $b A4 2016  
>100 1# $a Picasso, Pablo, $d 1881-1973, $e artist.  
>245 10 $a Picasso au Musée Soulages.    

*An exhibition catalog of selected paintings by Picasso. The conventional collective title Paintings. Selections would have been assigned prior to the new PCC policy. The Library of Congress Classification 
number ND553.P5 A4 is still used, since the form Cutter A4 includes exhibition catalogs.*

### Example 3-2  

>050 00 $a N6853.P5 $b A4 2017g  
>100 1# $a Picasso, Pablo, $d 1881-1973, $e artist.  
>240 10 $a Picasso (Capucins (Landerneau, France))  
>245 10 $a Picasso / $c sous la direction de Michel-Édouard Leclerc ; commissaire, Jean-Louis Andral.    

*A catalog of an exhibition of Picasso’s works held at the Capucins, Landerneau, France, June 25-November 1, 2017. The conventional collective title Works. Selections would have been assigned prior to the new PCC
policy. The access point of this resource would conflict with that of a different resource, so the conflict needs to be broken. The host institution was chosen to break the conflict, although date, publisher, etc., could also have been used. The classification number N6853.P5 A4 is still used, since the form Cutter A4 includes exhibition catalogs.*  

### Example 3-3  

> 050 00 $a ND237.L625 $b A4 2018  
> 100 1# $a LeWit, Sol, $d 1928-2007, $e artist.  
> 245 10 $a By hand : $b Sol LeWit : the first exhibition dedicated to Sol LeWit's gouache paintings.    

*An exhibition catalog of selected paintings by Sol LeWit. The conventional collective title Gouache paintings. Selections or Paintings. Selections might have been assigned prior to the new PCC policy. The Library of Congress Classification number ND237.L625 A4 is still used, since the form Cuter A4 includes exhibition catalogs.*
